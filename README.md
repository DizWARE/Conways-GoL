# Conways-GoL

A simple, static website version of Conway'0s Game of Life.

Originally written along side a Pluralsight video and left to decay over time.

The current code has basically been rewritten, but was first given to ChatGPT to convert from the old ES5 way that the code was originally written, to be in more modern Javascript.
From there, lots a tweeks went in to making the game nice and pretty.
